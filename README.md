# monthly-review

> A public log of engineering retrospectives, architectural reflections, and conscious evolution through code.  
> *“I = I + I — but only if I remember where I was.”*

This repository contains monthly self-reviews of my personal projects.  
Each entry documents:
- What I built (or didn’t build),
- What I misunderstood then but see clearly now,
- How my design principles evolved,
- And where I’m heading next.

This is not a showcase of perfection — it’s a record of **becoming**.

## 🧭 Principles
- **Honesty over polish**: I document flaws, not just wins.  
- **Growth over output**: No activity ≠ no progress.  
- **Clarity over noise**: Every line should carry signal.  
- **Google-style minimalism**: No fluff, only substance.

> Inspired by engineering practices at scale — but applied to one person’s journey.
