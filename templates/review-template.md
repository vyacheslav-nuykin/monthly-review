*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*  
*Theme: [One-sentence summary of the month’s engineering mood]*

## 🧠 State of Mind
> Brief reflection on energy, focus, and mental context.  
> _Example: “High output early month, creative block after Oct 25. Felt tension between learning and building.”_

## 🔍 Patterns Noticed
- Recurring anti-patterns or blind spots.  
- Shifts in tooling preferences (e.g., Docker → lighter alternatives).  
- Changes in architectural taste (monolith → micro? MVC → DDD?).

## 🚀 Direction for Next Month
- Concrete, small, actionable goals (1–3 items).  
  - _Example: “Reduce Spring Boot RAM usage to ≤1GB in dev mode.”_  
  - _Example: “Write one service in Go that calls a Java JAR via gRPC.”_

> “The best code I’ll ever write is the one I haven’t written yet — but only if I learn from the last.”
