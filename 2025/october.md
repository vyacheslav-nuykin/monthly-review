# October 2025 Retrospective  
*Date: 2025-10-31*  
*Theme: From Prototype to Production — The Emergence of Engineering Discipline*

## 🧠 State of Mind
October was a month of intense output followed by abrupt silence after Oct 29. The early weeks were marked by focused development across Java, Go, and infrastructure tooling. By month’s end, a sense of saturation emerged — not from lack of ideas, but from the weight of having *outgrown* earlier versions of myself. This retrospective is an act of reconnection: not to fix the past, but to understand the trajectory.

## 📦 Projects Reviewed

### 1. [todo-api](https://github.com/vyacheslav-nuykin/todo-api)
- **What worked**:  
  - Achieved its core goal: first Spring Boot project, full CRUD, README present.
- **What I’d change now**:  
  - All business logic in controller → violates SRP.  
  - No validation, no DTOs, no repository layer.  
  - In-memory storage limits learning.  
- **Score**:  
  - Architecture: 2/5  
  - Maintainability: 2/5  
  - Goal alignment: 5/5  
  - Technical debt: 1/5  
  - Personal growth: 3/5

### 2. [expense-tracker](https://github.com/vyacheslav-nuykin/expense-tracker)
- **What worked**:  
  - Applied post-tutorial knowledge: Thymeleaf, PostgreSQL, basic MVC.  
  - README included, functional UI.
- **What I’d change now**:  
  - Controller still handles business logic directly.  
  - No service layer → tight coupling.  
  - No input validation or error boundaries.
- **Score**:  
  - Architecture: 3/5  
  - Maintainability: 1/5  
  - Goal alignment: 5/5  
  - Technical debt: 2/5  
  - Personal growth: 3/5

### 3. [todo-api-v2](https://github.com/vyacheslav-nuykin/todo-api-v2)
- **What worked**:  
  - Full enterprise-grade structure: DTOs, Service, Repository, Validation, Swagger, Actuator.  
  - Immutable DTOs, proper HTTP handling, Spring Security-ready.  
  - Production-ready logic, zero TODOs.
- **What I’d change now**:  
  - Add Dockerfile for containerization.  
  - Introduce integration tests.
- **Score**:  
  - Architecture: 5/5  
  - Maintainability: 4/5  
  - Goal alignment: 5/5  
  - Technical debt: 5/5  
  - Personal growth: 5/5

### 4. [docker-db-cli](https://github.com/vyacheslav-nuykin/docker-db-cli)
- **What worked**:  
  - Solves a real pain point: fast, safe, scriptable DB launching.  
  - Idempotent, cross-platform, secure (no shell injection).  
  - Optional GUI, PyInstaller support.
- **Note**:  
  - Architecture and validation designed by me; implementation AI-assisted and rigorously tested.  
  - Reflects Infrastructure-as-Code philosophy.
- **Not scored** — but recognized as a **tool of leverage**, not a learning artifact.

### 5. [my-first-go](https://github.com/vyacheslav-nuykin/my-first-go)
- **What worked**:  
  - Clean, modular Go structure: `config/`, `handlers/`, `services/`.  
  - `/health` and `/info` endpoints, Docker support, logging.  
  - No external dependencies — pure stdlib elegance.
- **What I’d change now**:  
  - Add graceful shutdown.  
  - Use env vars instead of hardcoded config.
- **Score**:  
  - Architecture: 5/5  
  - Maintainability: 5/5  
  - Goal alignment: — (exploratory, but exceeded expectations)  
  - Technical debt: 4/5  
  - Personal growth: 5/5

## 🔍 Patterns Noticed
- **Clear evolution**: Controller monolith → layered architecture → polyglot thinking.  
- **Tooling maturity**: From “just run it” to Docker, CLI automation, health checks.  
- **Philosophical shift**: Code is no longer “mine” — it’s a **public artifact** meant to be read, reused, and respected.

## 🚀 Direction for November
- Add Dockerfile to `todo-api-v2` → make it truly deployable.  
- Write a Go service that calls `todo-api-v2` via HTTP → practice polyglot integration.  
- Begin documenting architectural decisions in `ADR/` folder (Architecture Decision Records).  
- Revisit Neovim setup — aim for one full day of Go/Java dev without VS Code.
